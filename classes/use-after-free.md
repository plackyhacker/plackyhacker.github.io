# Use After Free (UaF) Bugs

After some time away from study I have started going over the [OffSec Advanced Windows Exploitation](https://www.offsec.com/courses/exp-401/) courseware again. As I was going over the VMWare Escape chapter it wasn't initially clear **why** code execution was acheived by exploiting a known Use after Free (UaF) bug. The course does a great job explaining **how** to get code execution (and way beyond taking control of RIP) but I thought I would expand on the **why**. The bug used in the example was discovered in 2017 but is a good case study of how code execution can be acheived from exploiting a UaF bug.

As I write this I will be extremely careful not to breach any non-disclosure agreements or copyright infringements with [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com), I will be using open source references throughout.
