# Use After Free (UaF) Bugs

After some time away from study I have started going over the OffSec Advanced Windows Exploitation Course again. As I was going over the VMWare Escape chapter it wasn't initially clear **why** code execution was acheived by exploiting a known Use after Free (UaF) bug. The course does a great job explaining **how** to get code execution but I thought I would expand on the **why**.

## What are UaF Bugs?

# Virtual Function Tables

# The Use After Silence Bug
