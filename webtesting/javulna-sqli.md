# Javulna Auth Bypass and RCE Walkthrough

[Home](https://plackyhacker.github.io)

At the time of writing I am currently studying OSWE and I decided to do a bit of Java MVC exploitation as part of my studies. The OSWE exam requires the candidate to bypass authentication and gain reverse shell in a single exploit script, so that's what I decided to do using the [Javulna](https://github.com/defdeveu/code.java.Javulna) vulnerable web app.

The OSWE is a source code review exam so I will use the Java code to find the vulnerabilities and exploit them.

The Javulna application is a REST API web application; this means there is no website front end.
