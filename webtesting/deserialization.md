 # Deserialization Attacks
 
 At the time of writing I am studying Offensive Security Windows User Mode Exploit Development (EXP-301). I completed the Offensive Security Certified Expert (OSCE) a few years ago and really enjoyed it. However, I am finding that EXP-301 goes in to much more depth than the OSCE. That is probably because the new OSCE3 is split into three areas that were covered in the single Cracking the Perimeter course of old.
