# ESXi, Workstation, and Fusion have Uninitialized memory usage, leading to an information leak

## Introduction

At the time of writing I am currently studying for me [OSEE](https://www.offsec.com/courses/exp-401/) exam. Alongside the course material I am looking at past CVEs to see if I can exploit them myself. As I learn effectively by 'teaching' I have decided to post my attempts here.

## CVE-2017-4905

This CVE affected **VMware ESXi** 6.5 without patch ESXi650-201703410-SG, 6.0 U3 without patch ESXi600-201703401-SG, 6.0 U2 without patch ESXi600-201703403-SG, 6.0 U1 without patch ESXi600-201703402-SG, 5.5 without patch ESXi550-201703401-SG; **Workstation Pro / Player 12.x** prior to 12.5.5; and **Fusion Pro / Fusion** 8.x prior to 8.5.6 have uninitialized memory usage.

The CVE relies upon the backdoor functionality in VMWare and was presented in the AWE course. However, I wanted to implement the backdoor protocol myself, differrent to how it was implemented in the course. I wanted to code the backdoor protocol (at least the elements that trigger the bug) entirely in `asm`.
