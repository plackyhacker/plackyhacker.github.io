## Repositories

[Suspended Thread Injection](https://github.com/plackyhacker/Suspended-Thread-Injection) - A Meterpreter injection technique using C# that attempts to bypass Defender.

[Shellcode Injection Techniques](https://github.com/plackyhacker/Shellcode-Injection-Techniques) - A collection of C# shellcode injection techniques. All techniques use an AES encrypted meterpreter payload. I will be building this project up as I learn, discover or develop more techniques. Some techniques are better than others at bypassing AV.

[Command Line Spoofer](https://github.com/plackyhacker/CmdLineSpoofer) - How to spoof the command line when spawning a new process from C#.

[Unhooking AV, Peruns Fart](https://github.com/plackyhacker/Peruns-Fart) - A C# application that unhooks AV and EDR to help run malicious code undetected. 

[Unhooking BitDefender AV](https://github.com/plackyhacker/Unhook-BitDefender) - Unhooks Bit Defender from NTDLL and KERNELBASE using a classic technique.

[Syscalls in C#](https://github.com/plackyhacker/Sys-Calls) - An example of using Syscalls in C# to get a meterpreter shell.

[AMSI Bypass](https://github.com/plackyhacker/AMSI-Bypass) - Some AMSI bypass techniques written in C and C#.
