# Welcome to my GitHub Blog.


I have studied Offensive Security topics for many years and work in a highly-sensitive industry as a cybersecurity professional. Previously, I worked in Information Technology for over twenty years, and I have always been 'fascinated' with 'exploitation'. I have completed all the requirements and criteria to earn the [OSCP](https://www.offsec.com/courses/pen-200/), [OSCE](https://www.offsec.com/ctp-osce/) (discontinued), and [OSCE<sup>3</sup>](https://www.offsec.com/offsec/osce3-certification/) certifications. You can find me on GitHub and LinkedIn. And you can view my Offensive Security credentials on [Accredible](https://www.credential.net/profile/johntear402666/wallet). I hope to take the [OSEE](https://www.offsec.com/courses/exp-401/) at least once!

Here I will write about things I find interesting, and hopefully about things that I struggle to find elsewhere.
